     <h1>Sıfırdan Linux Projesi Nedir?</h1>
     <p> 
         Sıfırddan Linux (LFS), tamamen kaynak kod'dan kendiniz için özelleştirilmiş Linux sisteminizi oluşturmak için adım adım talimatlar sağlayan bir projedir.
     </p>

     <h2>Neden Sıfırdan Linux?</h2>
     <p>Many wonder why they should go through the hassle of building a Linux
        system from scratch when they could just download an existing Linux
        distribution. However, there are several benefits of building LFS.
        Consider the following:
     </p>

     <p><em>LFS teaches people how a Linux system works internally</em><br />
        Building LFS teaches you about all that makes Linux tick, how things
        work together and depend on each other. And most importantly, how to
        customize it to your own tastes and needs.
     </p>
     
     <p><em>Building LFS produces a very compact Linux system</em><br />
        When you install a regular distribution, you often end up installing a lot of programs that
        you would probably never use. They're just sitting there taking up (precious)
        disk space. It's not hard to get an LFS system installed under 100 MB. Does
        that still sound like a lot? A few of us have been working on creating a
        very small embedded LFS system. We installed a system that was just enough
        to run the Apache web server; total disk space usage was approximately 8 MB.
        With further stripping, that can be brought down to 5 MB or less. Try that
        with a regular distribution.
     </p>
     
     <p><em>LFS is extremely flexible</em><br />
        Building LFS could be compared to a finished
        house. LFS will give you the skeleton of a house, but it's up to you to install
        plumbing, electrical outlets, kitchen, bath, wallpaper, etc. You have the ability
        to turn it into whatever type of system you need it to be, customized completely
        for you.
     </p>
     
     <p><em>LFS offers you added security</em><br />
        You will compile the entire system from
        source, thus allowing you to audit everything, if you wish to do so, and apply
        all the security patches you want or need to apply. You don't have to wait for
        someone else to provide a new binary package that (hopefully) fixes a security hole.
        Often, you never truly know whether a security hole is fixed or not unless you do it
        yourself.
     </p>

     <h2>What can I do with my LFS system?</h2>
     
     <p>A by-the-book LFS system is fairly minimal, but is designed to provide a
        strong base on which you can add any packages you want.  See the
        <a href="../blfs/">BLFS project</a> for a
        selection of commonly used packages.
